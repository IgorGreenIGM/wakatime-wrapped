## ðŸš€ Overview
WakaTime is a platform I use extensively to track and visualize my coding statistics. It helps me measure my programming time, see which projects Iâ€™ve spent the most time on, and evaluate my productivity.

While looking at my Spotify Wrapped, I thought: why not create something similar for WakaTime? A fun and visual way to recap an entire year of coding. Thatâ€™s how WakaTime Wrapped was born.

WakaTime Wrapped makes it easy to visualize your yearly coding stats through stunning animations and interactive displays. You can download a personalized video or a beautifully designed card that showcases your data, ready to share with friends or on social media.

This was an exciting project to work on, blending creativity and technology to celebrate the unique coding journey of every developer.
