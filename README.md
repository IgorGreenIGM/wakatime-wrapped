## ðŸš€ Overview
As a passionate WakaTime user, I wanted a fun way to relive my coding journey over the yearâ€”just like Spotify Wrapped does for music. Thatâ€™s why I created WakaTime Wrapped, a platform to turn yearly coding stats into stunning animations, interactive displays, and shareable videos or cards.

## âœ¨ Features
1. **Yearly Coding Overview**  
   - Provides a comprehensive summary of your yearly coding statistics, including total hours, languages, projects, and editors used.

2. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Dynamic, interactive animations that bring your coding journey to life.

3. **Shareable Downloadables**  
   - Generate and download personalized video recaps or beautifully designed cards with your statistics, perfect for sharing on social media.

4. **Language & Project Highlights**  
   - See which programming languages you used the most and which projects took up most of your time.

5. **Milestone Recognition**  
   - Highlights significant achievements and coding milestones from your year.
